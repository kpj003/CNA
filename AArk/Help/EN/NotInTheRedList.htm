		<br>
		The number of species on earth is incredibly large - possibly up to 50 
		million. This means that many species, including amphibians, haven’t 
		even been discovered or described yet and have therefore not yet been 
		included in the
		<a target="_blank" href="http://www.iucnredlist.org" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: 700">
		<font color="#006600">IUCN Red List</font></a>. Species that are already 
		known to science might not be found in the Red List because assessing 
		species and their conservation status requires a great amount of 
		scientific work and money and with limited budgets, not all species can 
		be assessed.</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">As it is not possible 
		to evaluate all known species, the IUCN and the

		<font color="#006600">Species Survival Commission</font></a> (SSC) are 
		working to cover key taxonomic groups: The
		<a target="_blank" href="http://www.iucn.org/about/work/programmes/species/our_work/the_iucn_red_list/biodiversity_assessments_and_indicators_work_/" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: 700">
		<font color="#006600">Biodiversity Assessment Initiative</font></a> aims 
		to provide an effective method for gathering scientific data available 
		for biodiversity conservation.<br>
		<br>
		The first taxonomic group to be completely assessed under the Initiative 
		was amphibians (frogs, toads, salamanders, and caecilians). The results 
		of the Global Amphibian Assessment (GAA), released in 2004, were 
		alarming: one in three amphibian species face extinction.<br>
		<br>
		While updates to the amphibian database have been incremental, there has 
		not been a major comprehensive amphibian assessment since 2004. Since 
		2004 the database has been slowly but continually updated to include 
		newly-described or revalidated species and new information. The 
		assessment of amphibians is ongoing and relies on the expertise of 
		hundreds of herpetologists from all around the world. However, as it is 
		a continuous ‘work in progress’ some amphibian species might not be 
		included in the Red List at a given moment in time. For further 
		information on the assessment process see the
