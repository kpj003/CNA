		species have assessments?</font><br>
		<font size="2"><br>
		There are currently over 7,000 known amphibian species, and as more 
		field research is done, additional species are regularly being 
		discovered and described. Species that are already known might not have 
		had their conservation needs assessed because assessing species and 
		their conservation status requires a great amount of time and effort, 
		and with limited budgets, it takes time for all species to be assessed. 
		There are also many amphibian species for which very little about their 
		status in the wild is known, and additional information is required 
		before a through conservation needs assessment can be completed.<br>
		<br>
		From 2007-2104, Amphibian Ark staff worked with IUCN
		<a target="_blank" href="http://www.amphibians.org/asg/members/" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: 700">
		<font color="#006600">Amphibian Specialist Group (ASG) Chairs</font></a> 
		to assess the conservation needs of of 3,375 (46%) of the world’s 
		amphibian species through 26 national or regional workshops. During most 
		of those 26 assessment workshops, all amphibian species in each country 
		were assessed, resulting in complete national amphibian conservation 
		assessments. All of those assessments have been migrated to the new 
		online program, however some of the earliest assessments were undertaken 
		using a much simpler assessment process, meaning that only half of the 
		current assessment questions have been answered in those assessments. 
		Those assessments have been marked as “draft” and will not be included 
		in reports until they have been updated, completed and approved. <br>
		<br>
		At the beginning of 2015, the online Conservation Needs Assessment 
		program was launched, and although we plan to continue to work with 
		national ASG Chairs to focus assessments for all species at the national 
		level, and to ensure that all species within each country are assessed 
		within a relatively short timeframe, assessors are able to create 
		assessments for any species, in any country, whenever they wish. This 
		may result in some countries having only a percentage of their species 
		being assessed.<br>
		<br>
		The assessment of amphibians is ongoing and relies on the expertise of 
		hundreds of herpetologists from all around the world. New assessments 
		are required for species that have not yet been assessed, and it is 
		recommended that existing assessments be reviewed and updated at least 
		every five years, or whenever new information is discovered. However, as 
		it is a continuous ‘work in progress’ some amphibian species might not 
		be included in the Conservation Needs Assessment at a given moment in 
		time. As more amphibian experts become assessors, additional species 
		assessments will be undertaken.</font></font></td>
