		The conservation community who will use the recommendations from the 
		assessments include conservation program managers from zoos, aquariums 
		and other <i>ex situ </i>organizations, along with field researchers, 
		amphibian conservationists and government wildlife departments. In 
		addition, general visitors that are interested in the assessment process 
		or in viewing the data for their own interests can also access completed 
		assessments. All competed assessments can be viewed by all visitors to 
		the site and assessment data is updated by the authors of each 
		individual assessment.<br>
		<br>
		Click on “View Assessments” at the top of any page, or on the Home page, 
		click the “Find a species assessment” link to view completed 
		assessments. You can perform a search by country, by species name, or by 
		using a combination of both. To search for all species assessments 
		within a country, use the drop-down menu to select the country (note: 
		all countries for which assessments exist will be listed; although all 
		species within a country may not have been assessed). </font></font>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">To search by species name, you can enter 
		the scientific name (genus and/or species) or the common name. The 
		search engine will find all species that contain all or part of the 
		entry. Example: Enter “<i>Acris</i>”. Result: species with the genus <i>
		Acris</i> and <i>Pseudacris</i>. </font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The grid will show each species’ country, 
		scientific name, common name, local common name and who performed the 
		assessment. Clicking on the hyperlinked scientific name will display the 
		assessment details. <br>
