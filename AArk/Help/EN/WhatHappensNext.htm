		after the Conservation Needs Assessment?</font><br>
		<font size="2"><br>
		The Conservation Needs Assessments are a guide for the development of 
		further conservation actions. At the national level, this is most often 
		a National Action Plan for the group of species being assessed (e.g. 
		Amphibians). Conservation practitioners are then able to focus their 
		efforts and resources on the species and environments that are most in 
		need of help, and are likely to benefit the most from those efforts. 
		National action plans generally contain detailed and prioritized 
		conservation actions for both in situ and ex situ programs, and often 
		contain species-level actions for all threatened species.<br>
		<br>
		Some examples of recent national amphibian actions include

		<a href="WhatIsTheACAP.htm" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: 700">
		<font color="#006600">Amphibian Conservation Action Plan</font></a> 
		provides an excellent framework for developing national action plans.<br>
		<br>
		Before a comprehensive national action plan can be developed, it is 
		important that all species in the Class (e.g. Amphibians) have been 
		assessed or, as an absolute minimum, all species listed as threatened in 
		the IUCN Red List (i.e. Critically Endangered, Endangered and 
		Vulnerable). Furthermore, it is strongly recommended that all Data 
		Deficient species have been assessed for their conservation needs.<br>
		<br>
		Once these assessments have been
		<a href="ApprovingAssessments.htm" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: 700">
		<font color="#006600">reviewed and approved</font></a> by the
		<a href="http://www.conservationneeds.org/ApprovedUsers.aspx" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: 700">
		<font color="#006600">National Facilitator</font></a> (normally the IUCN
		<a target="_blank" href="http://www.amphibians.org/asg/members/" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: 700">
		<font color="#006600">Amphibian Specialist Group (ASG) Chairs</font></a>), 
		the next step is to form a working group of all national stakeholders, 
		to begin the process of either developing a new national amphibian 
		action plan, or updating an existing plan. Stakeholders that should be 
		included in the group are ASG members, leading amphibian field 
		biologists and researchers, representatives from the <i>ex situ </i>
		amphibian conservation community (zoos, aquariums, and national/regional 
		zoo associations) and government wildlife agencies as well as university 
		students.<br>
		<br>
		The prioritized conservation actions lists and list of assessments for 
		the country should be printed or exported from the assessment program, 
		and circulated to all working group members to ensure they are familiar 
		with the assessment results, and to ensure that all existing expertise 
		was captured.<br>
		<br>
		<b><i>Ex situ</i><br>
		</b>A National Action Plan consists of both <i>in situ </i>and <i>ex 
		situ </i>conservation programs. First we discuss the steps for 
		implementing a new <i>ex situ </i>program. We strongly suggest that each 
		institution considering implementing a new <i>ex situ </i>program uses 
		AArk’s
		<a target="_blank" href="http://www.amphibianark.org/resources/amphibian-husbandry/adequate-resources/" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: 700">
		<font color="#006600">Program Implementation Tool</font></a> to ensure 
		that all appropriate resources are in place. A new program should be 
		implemented if and only if all of the critical program aspects can be 
		met for a species. A sufficient number of founder animals (unrelated 
		individuals who help establish a population) must be available to ensure 
		a genetically viable captive population, but unfortunately, this is 
		often over-looked when new programs are established. AArk’s
		<a target="_blank" href="http://www.amphibianark.org/resources/amphibian-husbandry/founder-animals/" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: 700">
		<font color="#006600">Founder Calculation Tool</font></a> helps to 
		calculate the number of founders that should be collected, based on the 
		reproductive biology of the species <br>
		<br>
		It is also important to ensure that a complete taxonomic analysis of the 
		species in the wild has been carried out, to fully understand the 
		functional unit you wish to conserve, Typically this unit is a species; 
		however, because species are continuously changing units evolving 
		through time, there are often distinct but not yet unique subunits 
		(Evolutionary Significant Unit or ESU) in the process of divergence 
		within the species that might warrant independent consideration. If 
		there is insufficient knowledge of the species, a taxonomic study, 
		including phylogenetic analyses of DNA, should be undertaken before 
		considering an <i>ex situ </i>program for the species. This research 
		should be carried out in conjunction with local field biologists in 
		order to confirm that the specific program encompasses only ONE 
		evolutionary distinct unit (ESU) before proceeding.<br>
		<br>
		If all conditions are met, and a new <i>ex situ </i>conservation program 
		is implemented, then a
		<a target="_blank" href="http://www.amphibianark.org/resources/amphibian-husbandry/taxon-management/" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: 700">
		<font color="#006600">Taxon Management Group</font></a> should be 
		established. It is important to ensure within this group appropriate 
		representation from all of the stakeholder groups who have an interest 
		in the species being managed, including the captive breeding community, 
		zoo association amphibian taxon advisory group representatives, field 
		biologists and researchers, and those involved with attempting to 
		mitigate threats in the wild. Forming a management group will ensure 
		that all stakeholders’ needs are met, that expertise is available on all 
		aspects of managing an integrated program, and that the management 
		processes are transparent.<br>
		<br>
		<i><b>In situ<br>
		</b></i>Recommendations generated from the assessments for <i>in situ
		</i>conservation actions include <i>in situ </i>research (for species 
		where one or more critical pieces of information is not known at this 
		time) and <i>in situ </i>conservation (for species for which mitigation 
		of threats in the wild may still bring about its’ successful 
		conservation). <br>
		<br>
		In many countries the
		<a target="_blank" href="http://www.amphibians.org/asg/members/" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: 700">
		<font color="#006600">ASG</font></a> takes a leading role in amphibian 
		conservation actions, especially with in situ activities.<br>
		<br>
		<b>The One Plan Approach</b><br>

		<a target="_blank" href="http://www.cbsg.org" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: 700">
		<font color="#006600">Conservation Breeding Specialist Group</font></a> 
		(CBSG) is the development of management strategies and conservation 
		actions by all responsible parties for all populations of a species, 
		whether inside or outside their natural range.<br>
		<br>
		Traditionally, species conservation planning has followed two parallel 
		but separate tracks. Field biologists, wildlife managers, and 
		conservationists monitor wild populations and develop conservation 
		strategies and actions to conserve threatened species. Meanwhile, the 
		zoo and aquarium community develops long-term goals for sustaining <i>ex 
		situ </i>populations.<br>
		<br>
		CBSG supports an integrated approach to species conservation planning 
		through the joint development of management strategies and conservation 
		actions by all responsible parties. As a result, one comprehensive 
		conservation plan for the species helps bridge the gap between wild and 
		captive population management.</font></font></td>
