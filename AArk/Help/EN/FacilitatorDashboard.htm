		<b>Approve a Request from a New Assessor</b><br>
		When someone applies to become a new assessor, their name and profile 
		information (organization, email, country, expertise- species and 
		countries, and ASG membership status) will then be shown on the Assessor 
		approval grid on the dashboard. The grid will list users that have asked 
		for approval within the last 6 months. The list will consist of both 
		unapproved and approved users with those who are yet to be approved at 
		the top of the list, sorted by date of request. All Facilitators can 
		view the list and should only approve those people whose expertise they 
		are sure of, usually those with expertise within the same 
		country/region. For those on the list with Not Approved within the 
		Status column, the Facilitator can select “Approve” or “Deny”. If the 
		Facilitator selects “Approve”, the status for the person will change to 
		Approved and they will be enabled to submit assessments. If for any 
		reason, the status of an approved Assessor changes (e.g., if another 
		Facilitator has additional knowledge of their expertise), a Facilitator 
		can select “Unapprove” to remove the user’s ability to add or edit 
		assessments.<br>
		<br>
		<b>Approve Completed Assessments<br>
		</b>When Assessors have completed an assessment, they mark it as 
		“complete”. The completed assessments then need to be reviewed and 
		approved by a Facilitator and they show up on the “Approve completed 
		assessments” grid. The Facilitators search for the completed assessments 
		within their country/region, and then review the assessments. They 
		either approve them by clicking on the “Approved” link to formalize the 
		assessments or contact the Assessor for any issue that they have with 
		the assessment. These approved assessments will then show up on the 
		species assessment list and are viewable to any users of the website. 
		Only completed and approved assessments are included in national and 
		global conservation action reports.<br>
		<br>
		<b>My Incomplete Assessments</b><br>
		Facilitators may also perform assessments so they need to view a list of 
		their own incomplete assessments. Any assessment that you have done that 
		is not marked “complete” will automatically show up in this list. The 
		assessment is incomplete if you saved it as a draft to finish on another 
		day or while looking up some references in order to answer the 
		questions. You can view the assessment by clicking on the scientific 
		name, or you can edit your assessment by clicking the “Complete my 
		assessment” link and continue to add information to the assessment. The 
		assessment is complete when you have answered all the questions to the 
		best of your knowledge, even if there are some questions that you are 
		not able to answer. You then should check the box for “Mark my 
		assessment as complete” and click the “Save Assessment” button.<br>
		<br>
		<b>Edit My Profile</b><br>
		Click on the green link to update your profile details such as contact 
		information (email address, phone number, country of residence), your 
		preferred default language and job information (job title, 
		organization). You can also change your password and update your 
		geographic areas of expertise, but please note that your username cannot 
		be changed. After updating your details, click the “Save” button. </font></td>
