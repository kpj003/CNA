		<font color="#006600">Amphibian Ark</font></a> seeks to objectively and 
		consistently identify priority species and their immediate conservation 
		needs.<br>
		<br>
		The Conservation Needs Assessment process was initially developed in 
		2006, during an
		<a target="_blank" href="http://www.amphibianark.org/pdf/Ex_Situ_Planning_Workshop_Report.pdf" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: 700">
		<font color="#006600">Amphibian <i>Ex Situ </i>Conservation Planning 
		workshop</font></a> in El Valle de Anton, Panama, when a taxon selection 
		and prioritization working group developed a decision tree for the 
		selection and prioritization of species that are most in need of <i>ex 
		situ </i>(captive) assistance. The decision tree has subsequently been 
		further reviewed and refined, and has now evolved into the Amphibian Ark 
		Conservation Needs Assessment process, which now generates prioritized recommendations 
		for both <i>in situ </i>(in the wild) and <i>ex situ </i>
		conservation actions. The assessment process has proven to be a logical, 
		transparent, and repeatable procedure for guiding amphibian conservation 
		activities within a country or region.<br>
		<br>
		Between 2007 and the end of 2014, Amphibian Ark staff have facilitated 
		workshops to assess the conservation needs of 3,375 (46%) of the world’s 
		amphibian species at 26
		<a target="_blank" href="http://www.amphibianark.org/about-us/aark-activities/planning-workshops/" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: 700">
		<font color="#006600">national or regional workshops</font></a>. With 
		funding for physical workshops becoming more and more scarce, the 
		decision was made to build an online application to replicate the 
		assessment process as a solution for ensuring assessments could 
		continue. In late 2014 a new, online assessment program was developed, 
		and all previous assessments were migrated into the online database. <br>
		<br>
		The conservation needs assessment tool has been structured in two 
		sections: The first section concerns assessing species for both <i>in 
		situ</i> and <i>ex situ </i>conservation actions - i.e. with limited 
		resources (space, staff, money etc.) which species should have <i>ex 
		situ </i>programs established ahead of others; which species urgently 
		need field research or protection, etc. It takes the form of a
		<a href="QuestionsAnswers.htm" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: 700">
		<font color="#006600">series of questions</font></a> with weighted 
		scores. The total score for a species determines its priority for 
		conservation action. <br>
		<br>
		The second section includes
		<a href="QuestionsAnswers.htm" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: 700">
		<font color="#006600">questions</font></a> ensuring that there is 
		authorization for any proposed <i>ex situ </i>conservation program, and 
		that founder animals are available. Some questions may not be 
		straightforward to answer and will require consultation with colleagues, 
		taxonomic experts and other individuals/groups working with the species.<br>
		<br>
		The information provided in sections one and two is then used to 
		categorize each species for one or more
		<a href="ConservationActions.htm" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: 700">
		<font color="#006600">conservation actions</font></a>. A series of 
		reports {<font color="#FF0000">link to reports?</font>} is available for 
		each conservation action, and these are then be used to guide the next 
		steps required for the conservation of each species. At the national 
		level, this is most often a National Action Plan for the group of 
		species being assessed (e.g. Amphibians). Conservation practitioners are 
		then able to focus their efforts and resources on the species and 
		environments that are most in need of help, and are likely to benefit 
		the most from those efforts.<br>
		<br>
		The Conservation Needs Assessment process has been an evolving protocol. 
		The criteria and their rankings have been adjusted as experience with 
		the process was gained, and we continue to work with the broader 
		conservation community to identify goals, threats, and conservation 
		options. Assessments and prioritisation of individual species is 
		reviewed and updated as we gain knowledge and as the threats to each 
		species change. Thus, there will be a need to constantly assess species 
		status and monitor threats, so that emerging critical situations are 
		responded to sufficiently quickly.<br>
		<br>
		<b>Online assessments</b><br>
		Prior to the development of this online application, Conservation Needs 
		Assessments were generally carried out during physical workshops, where 
		scientists, field biologists, animal husbandry experts and other 
		stakeholders met, and worked as a single group to assess all of the 
		species of a given Class (e.g. amphibians), in the particular country or 
		region. This process results in a single assessment for each species for 
		each of the countries that the species occurs in. Using this online 
		application multiple assessors {<font color="#FF0000">link to assessors 
		help page</font>} will work independently from each other, to assess 
		species, and generate subsequent conservation recommendations. If 
		multiple assessments exist for the same species in the same countries, 
		they will be consolidated, to give a final, single set of recommended 
		conservation actions for each species.<br>
		<br>
		From early 2015 onwards, national conservation needs assessments can now 
		be undertaken either during a physical workshop or by using the online 
		program. Assessments from previous workshops can also be reviewed and 
		updated using the online process. <br>
		<br>
		Advantages and disadvantages of both the workshop and the online method 
		of assessment are discussed on the

		all amphibian species in their country over a relatively short time 
		period, with the subsequent assessments and recommendations for
