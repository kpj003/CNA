		<font color="#006600">Amphibian Ark</font></a> seeks to objectively and 
		consistently identify priority species and their immediate conservation 
		needs.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		The Conservation Needs Assessment process was initially developed in 
		2006, during an <b>
		<a style="text-decoration: none; target" _blank" href="http://www.amphibianark.org/pdf/Ex_Situ_Planning_Workshop_Report.pdf">
		<font color="#006600">Amphibian Ex Situ Conservation Planning workshop</font></a></b> 
		in El Valle de Anton, Panama, when a taxon selection and prioritization 
		working group developed a decision tree for the selection and 
		prioritization of species that are most in need of ex situ (captive) 
		assistance. The decision tree has subsequently been further reviewed and 
		refined, and has now evolved into the Amphibian Ark Conservation Needs 
		Assessment process. The assessment process has proven to be a logical, 
		transparent, and repeatable procedure for guiding amphibian conservation 
		activities within a country or region.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		Between 2007 and the end of 2014, Amphibian Ark staff have facilitated 
		workshops to assess the conservation needs of 3,375 (46%) of the world’s 
		amphibian species at 26 national or regional workshops. With funding for 
		physical workshops becoming more and more scarce, the decision was made 
		to build an online application to replicate the assessment process as a 
		solution for ensuring assessments could continue. In late 2014 a new, 
		online assessment program was developed, and all previous assessments 
		were migrated into the online database. </font></font></td>
