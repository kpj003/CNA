		<font color="#006600">Amphibian Conservation Action Plan</font></a> (ACAP) is the science community’s 
		urgent call for globally coordinated conservation action to address the 
		alarming increase in amphibian extinctions. <br>

		in the late 1980s herpetologists reported amphibians had gone missing 
		within protected parks and reserves. Since then research has shown that 
		modern amphibian declines and extinctions have no precedent over the 
		last few millennia. The first Global Amphibian Assessment in 2004 
		documented the breadth of amphibian losses worldwide: about 32% of some 
		6,000 amphibian species were shown to be threatened at that time and 
		population size was declining in at least 43% of species. A summit was 
		convened in September 2005 to devise a unified strategy for amphibian 
		conservation in the form of the Amphibian Conservation Action Plan. The 
		ACAP originally outlined a five-year plan to curtail the decline and 
		extinction of amphibians, and focuses on eleven themes, including 
		designing a network of conservation sites for amphibians and captive 
		breeding programs.<br>
		<br>
		The ACAP aims to counter amphibian decline through four recommended 
		actions by researchers and conservation biologists: (1) Expand 
		scientific understanding of amphibian declines and extinctions; (2) 
		continue to document amphibian diversity and ecology and how they are 
		changing; (3) develop and implement long-term conservation programs; (4) 
		prepare emergency response actions for eminent crises.<br>
		<br>
		The ACAP offers practical, large-scale, innovative and realistic actions 
		to combat the extinction of amphibian species. The global strategy 
		focuses on survival assurance colonies, disease research, and habitat 
		protection. At the same time, other threats including climate change, 
		over-harvesting, and toxins are not forgotten. For instance, climate 
		change contributed to the extinction of the Costa Rican Golden Toad (<i>Bufo 
		periglenes</i>) and over-harvesting is severely threatening several of 
		China’s remarkable frogs and salamanders. <br>
		<br>
		The ACAP is designed to provide guidance for implementing amphibian 
		conservation and research initiatives at all scales from global to 
		local. The ACAP can provide a blueprint for local NGOs seeking to 
		incorporate amphibians into management plans of protected areas or 
		devise a regional or national strategy for amphibian conservation, for 
		governments seeking to fulfil their

		<font color="#006600">Convention on Biological Diversity</font></a> (CBD) 
		2010 targets, or for researchers working to fill crucial gaps in 
		knowledge. <br>
		<br>
		To provide an example of its implementation, the ACAP has been adopted 
		as a framework for developing National Amphibian Action Plans in 
		Madagascar and Costa Rica. Locally-held workshops addressed the themes 
		relevant to each region to come up with a national strategy to combat 
		amphibian declines. Certain themes within the ACAP were more relevant to 
		one country than the other and the respective national action plans were 
		tailored to reflect this.</font></td>
