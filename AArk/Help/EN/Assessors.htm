		Scientists, field biologists and researchers, animal husbandry experts 
		and others are vital to the success of the Conservation Needs 
		Assessments. Sharing your expertise and experiences will enhance the 
		assessments, ensuring that appropriate recommendations for national and 
		global conservation actions are delivered where they are most needed.<br>
		<br>
		A complete Conservation Needs Assessment for each species includes 
		current information on the status of the species in the wild; suitable 
		habitat; the threats facing each species; cultural, scientific, 
		socio-economic and phylogenetic significance; and past <i>ex situ </i>
		experience with the species, as well as information about potential 
		authorization for any proposed <i>ex situ </i>conservation programs, and 
		the availability of founder animals. Some of this information is best 
		provided by field biologists and researchers, and some will be provided 
		by people with relevant experience or knowledge of past <i>ex situ </i>
		conservation programs.<br>
		<br>
		We welcome anyone with the appropriate expertise to contribute to the 
		assessments, and if you would like to become an Assessor {<font color="#FF0000">link 
		to Becoming an assessor help page</font>}, please complete the short 
		registration form on the Home page. Your request will be verified and 
		approved by the appropriate

		<font color="#006600">National Facilitator</font></a> - normally IUCN 
		Amphibian Specialist Group (ASG) Chairs, or Amphibian Ark staff, and you 
		will receive a welcome email as soon as your request as been approved. 
		This approval process ensures that all Assessors have appropriate 
		expertise, resulting in assessments and the conservation actions 
		recommended by those assessments that are of the highest possible 
		quality.</font></font></td>
