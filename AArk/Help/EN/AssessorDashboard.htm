		<b>My Incomplete Assessments</b><br>
		Any assessment that you have done that is not marked “complete” will 
		automatically show up in this list. The assessment is incomplete if you 
		saved it as a draft to finish on another day or while looking up some 
		references in order to answer the questions. You can view the assessment 
		by clicking on the scientific name, or you can edit your assessment by 
		clicking the “Complete my assessment” link and continue to add 
		information to the assessment. The assessment is complete when you have 
		answered all the questions to the best of your knowledge, even if there 
		are some questions that you are not able to answer. You then should 
		check the box for “Mark my assessment as complete” and click the “Save 
		Assessment” button.<br>
		<br>
		<b>Edit My Profile</b><br>
		Click on the green link to update your profile details such as contact 
		information (email address, phone number, country of residence), your 
		preferred default language and job information (job title, 
		organization). You can also change your password and update your 
		geographic areas of expertise, but please note that your username cannot 
		be changed. After updating your details, click the “Save” button.</font></td>
