		<font color="#006600">Amphibian <i>Ex Situ </i>Conservation Planning 
		workshop</font></a> in El Valle, Panama, and during that workshop, a 
		taxon selection and prioritization working group developed a series of 
		questions to select and prioritize which species are most in need of <i>
		ex situ </i>assistance.<br>
		<br>
		The decision tree has subsequently been further reviewed and refined, 
		and has now been developed into the AArk Conservation Needs Assessment 
		process, which has proven to be a logical, transparent, and repeatable 
		procedure for guiding amphibian conservation activities within a country 
		or region.<br>
		<br>
		Assessors with appropriate expertise {<font color="#FF0000">link to who 
		are assessors?</font>} answer the following questions for each species 
		of amphibian in a country or region, and the responses to the questions 
		are then used to generate recommended <i>in situ</i> (in the field) or
		<i>ex situ </i>(in captivity)
		<a href="ConservationActions.htm" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: 700">
		<font color="#006600">conservation actions</font></a> for each species. 
		Scores associated with the answers are used to create a total score for 
		each assessment, which is then used to prioritize species for 
		conservation action in each country or region.<br>
		<br>
		The questions are grouped into seven sections.<br>
		<br>
		<b><font color="#006600">Section One – Review of external data</font></b><br>

		<font color="#006600">IUCN Red List</font></a>.]<br>
		<br>
		The Red List category can be modified accordingly (for the purposes of 
		this assessment only) if new/additional information is available, or if 
		country-level Red List assessments exist. If the assessors consider that 
		the Red List category of threat would change if the species was 
		re-assessed using more current data that that which was used previously, 
		or if a more recent national Red List assessment exists, a revised 
		estimate of the new category can be chosen, and this will be used to 
		calculate priorities and conservation actions. <br>

				<td><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Extinct (EX)</b><br>
				A taxon is Extinct when there is no reasonable doubt that the 
				last individual has died. A taxon is presumed Extinct when 
				exhaustive surveys in known and/or expected habitat, at 
				appropriate times (diurnal, seasonal, annual), throughout its 
				historic range have failed to record an individual. Surveys 
				should be over a time frame appropriate to the taxon’s life 
				cycle and life form.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Extinct in the Wild (EW)</b><br>
				A taxon is Extinct in the Wild when it is known only to survive 
				in cultivation, in captivity or as a naturalized population (or 
				populations) well outside the past range. A taxon is presumed 
				Extinct in the Wild when exhaustive surveys in known and/or 
				expected habitat, at appropriate times (diurnal, seasonal, 
				annual), throughout its historic range have failed to record an 
				individual. Surveys should be over a time frame appropriate to 
				the taxon’s life cycle and life form.</font><p>
				<font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Critically Endangered (CR)</b><br>
				A taxon is Critically Endangered when the best available 
				evidence indicates that it meets any of the criteria A to E for 
				Critically Endangered (see Section V), and it is therefore 
				considered to be facing an extremely high risk of extinction in 
				the wild.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Endangered (EN)</b><br>
				A taxon is Endangered when the best available evidence indicates 
				that it meets any of the criteria A to E for Endangered (see 
				Section V), and it is therefore considered to be facing a very 
				high risk of extinction in the wild.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Vulnerable (VU)</b><br>
				A taxon is Vulnerable when the best available evidence indicates 
				that it meets any of the criteria A to E for Vulnerable (see 
				Section V), and it is therefore considered to be facing a high 
				risk of extinction in the wild.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Near Threatened (NT)</b><br>
				A taxon is Near Threatened when it has been evaluated against 
				the criteria but does not qualify for Critically Endangered, 
				Endangered or Vulnerable now, but is close to qualifying for or 
				is likely to qualify for a threatened category in the near 
				future.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Least Concern (LC)</b><br>
				A taxon is Least Concern when it has been evaluated against the 
				criteria and does not qualify for Critically Endangered, 
				Endangered, Vulnerable or Near Threatened. Widespread and 
				abundant taxa are included in this category.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Data Deficient (DD)</b><br>
				A taxon is Data Deficient when there is inadequate information 
				to make a direct, or indirect, assessment of its risk of 
				extinction based on its distribution and/or population status. A 
				taxon in this category may be well studied, and its biology well 
				known, but appropriate data on abundance and/or distribution are 
				lacking. Data Deficient is therefore not a category of threat. 
				Listing of taxa in this category indicates that more information 
				is required and acknowledges the possibility that future 
				research will show that threatened classification is 
				appropriate. It is important to make positive use of whatever 
				data are available. In many cases great care should be exercised 
				in choosing between DD and a threatened status. If the range of 
				a taxon is suspected to be relatively circumscribed, and a 
				considerable period of time has elapsed since the last record of 
				the taxon, threatened status may well be justified.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Not Evaluated (NE)</b><br>
				A taxon is Not Evaluated when it has not yet been evaluated 
				against the criteria.</font></td>

		Using a scientific framework to identify the world’s most Evolutionarily

				This species is not currently facing any major threats in the

				safeguard this species in the wild.<br>
				<br>
				<b>(b) Species is effectively protected</b><br>
				All, or the majority of the population of the species in the

				<br>
				<b>(c) Threats unknown</b><br>

				<br>
				<b>(d) Threats are being managed - conservation dependant</b><br>
				Without the current management of the threat, the species would 
				disappear in the wild. Examples of this sort of management 
				include actions such as filling temporary ponds each year for 
				breeding, diverting a dam to create a torrent, or harvesting 
				predatory species.<br>
				<br>
				<b>(e) Threats are potentially reversible in a timeframe that will

				<b>(f) Threats cannot/will not be reversed in time to prevent likely

				The species will very likely go extinct in the wild before
