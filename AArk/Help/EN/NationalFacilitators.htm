		With a wide range of Assessors, from a variety of different backgrounds 
		adding assessments, it is vital to ensure that all Assessors have 
		appropriate expertise, and that all assessments and the conservation 
		actions recommended by those assessments that are of the highest 
		possible quality.

		<b>Approving new Assessors</b><br>
		Anyone who would like to become an
		<a href="Assessors.htm" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: 700">
		<font color="#006600">Assessor</font></a> completes the short 
		registration form on the Home page, and their request is then verified 
		and approved by the appropriate National Facilitator or Amphibian Ark 
		staff. The new Assessor then receives a welcome email as soon as their 
		request as been approved, and they are then welcome to start adding 
		assessments.<br>
		<br>
		<b>Approving new and updated assessments</b><br>
		To ensure a consistent level of detail and accuracy across assessments 
		that have been added by multiple Assessors, National Facilitators review 
		and approve all assessments for species within their country or region 
		of expertise. Although assessments that have not yet been approved are 
		visible to other Assessors, they are not included on the View 
		Assessments page, or within National Assessment reports until they have 
		been validated.<br>
		<br>
		When a new or an updated assessment is marked as complete by the 
		Assessor, the relevant National Facilitator is notified, and they can 
		then review the assessment. If they are happy with the content, and with 
		the level of supporting notes, they will then approve the assessment. If 
		they have any concerns with the assessment, the National Facilitator 
		will then contact the Assessor and discuss their concerns. When the 
		concerns have been addressed, the National Facilitator will then mark 
		the assessment as approved.</font></font></td>
