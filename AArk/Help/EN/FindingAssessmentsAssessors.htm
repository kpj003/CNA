		Assessors have access to their own incomplete assessments for editing 
		and completion and also can find a list of all their completed 
		assessments. On the Home Page click “Login to my assessments” which will 
		take you to the Login page and then to “<a href="AssessorDashboard.htm" style="text-decoration: none"><font color="#006600">My 
		Dashboard</font></a>”. There will be a grid containing the list of your 
		assessments that have not been marked as “Complete”. You can view the 
		assessment by clicking the scientific name or you can edit your 
		assessment by clicking the “Complete my assessment” link. <br>
		<br>
		To access all of your assessments (both incomplete and complete), click 
		on the “Add Assessments” link at the top of the page. You can search by 
		country or species (common or scientific name) and click the “Show only 
		my assessments” box. This will produce a list of all of the assessments 
		that you have contributed for that country or species. Within the grid, 
		you will be able to “Complete my assessment” for incomplete assessments, 
		or “Edit my assessment” for completed assessments.<br>
