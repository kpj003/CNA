		<td valign="top"><font face="Arial" color="#006600">Taxonomic changes and additions</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">The scientific and 
		common names which are used in the Conservation Needs Assessment 
		software are derived from a combination of the <b>
		<a target="_blank" href="http://www.iucnredlist.org/" style="text-decoration: none">
		<font color="#006600">IUCN Red List</font></a></b> and the <b>
		<a target="_blank" href="http://amphibiaweb.org/" style="text-decoration: none">
		<font color="#006600">AmphibiaWeb</font></a></b> database. These are the 
		two main taxonomic references that form the basis of the names in our 
		database.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2">However, taxonomy is a very dynamic field 
		of study and it is likely that some of the scientific and common names 
		in the current database might change in the future. The development of 
		molecular phylogenetics, focusing on hereditary molecular differences, 
		mainly in DNA sequences, is shedding new light on evolutionary 
		relationships between species. This relatively new line of taxonomic 
		research has driven many recent revisions and is likely to continue 
		doing so. Genus names change as further research is undertaken and 
		species can be lumped or split according to new findings.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2">A potential issue is the existence of one 
		or more synonyms for the same species: over time one amphibian species 
		may have received different names. The former scientific name has been 
		displaced by another scientific name, which is now regarded as correct. 
		This change might have been made recently, so it is possible that for 
		one species several synonyms are in circulation and being used at any 
		given time.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Fortunately we also see the discovery of 
		many new amphibian species every year. In fact, since the creation of 
		AmphibiaWeb some 25 years ago the total number of known amphibian 
		species has increased spectacularly from 4,000 to over 7,000 species. In 
		average, that equates to a staggering new species every two and a half 
		days.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Unfortunately, Amphibian Ark doesn’t have 
		the necessary resources to stay on top of new species names, changes to 
		genera etc. and often we find that local amphibian experts know one or 
		several new species that aren't yet included in the Red List or 
		AmphibiaWeb. We recognize that it is important to include all species in 
		our database, along with the most current species names, so we will add 
		or update anything that is brought to our attention.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2">So, if you would find any errors or 
		omissions in our species list, we kindly ask you to send us an email to
		<a href="mailto:ConservationNeeds@amphibianark.org?subject=Species in Conservation Needs Assessments" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: 700">
		<font color="#006600">ConservationNeeds@amphibianark.org</font></a> 
		indicating in the subject line that you would like a change made to the 
		species database, and send us the proposed change or addition. Please 
		also include a link to a valid reference document, so we can verify the 
		update.</font></td>
