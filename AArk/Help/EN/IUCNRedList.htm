		IUCN Red List?</font><br>
		<br>
		<font size="2"><b>Introduction</b><br>
		The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (also known as the IUCN Red List 
		or Red Data List), founded in 1964, gives an overview of the global 
		conservation status of animal and plant species, subspecies and 
		populations to highlight those threatened with extinction, to guide 
		conservation action. It is compiled by the
		<a target="_blank" href="http://iucn.org" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: 700">
		<font color="#006600">International Union for the Conservation of Nature</font></a> 
		(IUCN), specifically the IUCN Global Species Programme and its expert 
		network known as the
		<a target="_blank" href="http://www.iucn.org/about/work/programmes/species/who_we_are/about_the_species_survival_commission_/" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: 700">
		<font color="#006600">Species Survival Commission</font></a> (SSC).<br>
		<br>
		The IUCN Red List is continually being updated and is freely available 
		online at
		<a target="_blank" href="http://www.iucnredlist.org/" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: 700">
		<font color="#006600">www.iucnredlist.org</font></a>. It is based on an 
		objective system allowing assignment of any species (except 
		micro-organisms) to one of eight Red List Categories based on whether 
		they meet criteria linked to population trend, size and structure and 
		geographic range.<br>
		<br>
		By assessing the threat status of species, the IUCN Red List has two 
		goals: (i) to identify and document those species most in need of 
		conservation attention if global extinction rates are to be reduced; and 
		(ii) to provide a global index of the state of change of biodiversity.<br>
		<br>
		Around 73,000 species have been assessed to-date. This is a tiny 
		fraction (4.3%) of the world’s described species (with current estimates 
		of the total number ranging from 5 to 30 million). Of the 73,000, 
		approximately 60,000 species are currently well documented, with 
		information on ecology, population size, threats, conservation actions 
		and utilization. There are also about 45,000 species with distribution 
		maps. The data cover non-threatened as well as threatened species, and 
		certain taxonomic groups have been completely or almost completely 
		assessed.<br>
		<br>
		<a target="_blank" href="http://www.nationalredlist.org" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: 700">
		<font color="#006600">Regional and National Red Lists</font></a> provide 
		an equivalent method to assess species status at smaller spatial scales 
		– at the local, national or regional level. See the
		<font color="#FF0000">
		<a href="NationalRedList.htm" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: 700">
		<font color="#006600">What are national Red List assessments?</font></a></font> 
		page for additional information.<br>
		<br>
		The global IUCN Red List only includes information on species, 
		subspecies or populations that have been globally assessed; regional and 
		national level assessments are currently not included unless these are 
		also global assessments (for example, a species that is only found in 
		one country, (i.e., is endemic) and therefore has the same Red List 
		status at both national and global levels). For non-endemics, it is 
		important to note that the status of a species at the global level may 
		be different to that at a national level. In certain situations, a 
		species may be listed as threatened on a national Red List even though 
		it is considered Least Concern at the global level by IUCN and vice 
		versa. <br>
		<br>
		IUCN is also collaborating with other national Red List projects to 
		incorporate their data, especially on national endemics, into the global 
		IUCN Red List. IUCN and its Red List Partners are currently discussing 
		how to disseminate the data in the national and regional Red Lists more 
		effectively, especially those that are conducted using the IUCN 
		standards.<br>
		<br>
		<b>Amphibians</b></font></font><font size="2" face="Arial"><br>
		As it is not possible to evaluate all known species, the IUCN and the 
		SSC are working to cover key taxonomic groups: The Biodiversity 
		Assessment Initiative aims to provide an effective method for gathering 
		scientific data available for biodiversity conservation.<br>
		<br>
		The first taxonomic group to be completely assessed under the Initiative 
		was amphibians (frogs, toads, salamanders, and caecilians). The results 
		of the Global Amphibian Assessment (GAA), released in 2004, were 
		alarming: one in three amphibian species face extinction.<br>
		<br>
		While updates to the amphibian database have been incremental, there has 
		not been a major comprehensive amphibian assessment since 2004. Since 
		2004 the database has been slowly but continually updated to include 
		newly-described or revalidated species and new information. The 
		assessment of amphibians is ongoing and relies on the expertise of 
		hundreds of herpetologists from all around the world. For further 
		information on the assessment process see the
		<a target="_blank" href="http://www.amphibians.org/redlist/forum/" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: 700">

		<br>
		<b>Method</b><br>
		The IUCN Red List uses precise criteria to evaluate the extinction risk 
		of thousands of species and subspecies. These criteria are relevant to 
		all species and all regions of the world. <br>
		<br>
		The first Red List Criteria were adopted in 1994 (IUCN, 1994) after a 
		wide consultative process involving hundreds of scientists. The IUCN Red 
		List Categories and Criteria were revised in 2001 (IUCN, 2001). Each 
		species assessed is assigned to one of the following categories: 
		Extinct, Extinct in the Wild, Critically Endangered, Endangered, 
		Vulnerable, Near Threatened, Least Concern and Data Deficient, based on 
		a series of quantitative criteria linked to population trend, population 
		size and structure, and geographic range. Species classified as 
		Vulnerable, Endangered and Critically Endangered are regarded as 
		‘threatened’. <br>
		<br>
		The IUCN aims to have the category of every species re-evaluated every 
		five years if possible, or at least every ten years. This is done in a 
		peer reviewed manner through IUCN Species Survival Commission (SSC) 
		Specialist Groups.<br>
		<br>
		The IUCN Species Programme plays the lead role in helping to fund, 
		convene and facilitate the assessment workshops which drive much of the 
		data gathering and review process for the Red List.</font><p>
		<font face="Arial" size="2">All species assessments are based on data currently available for the 
		species (or subspecies, population) across its entire global range. <br>
		<br>
		<b>Categories and definitions</b><br>
		<br>
		<b>Extinct (EX)</b><br>
		A taxon is Extinct when there is no reasonable doubt that the last 
		individual has died. A taxon is presumed Extinct when exhaustive surveys 
		in known and/or expected habitat, at appropriate times (diurnal, 
		seasonal, annual), throughout its historic range have failed to record 
		an individual. Surveys should be over a time frame appropriate to the 
		taxon’s life cycle and life form.<br>
		<br>
		<b>Extinct in the Wild (EW)<br>
		</b>A taxon is Extinct in the Wild when it is known only to survive in 
		cultivation, in captivity or as a naturalized population (or 
		populations) well outside the past range. A taxon is presumed Extinct in 
		the Wild when exhaustive surveys in known and/or expected habitat, at 
		appropriate times (diurnal, seasonal, annual), throughout its historic 
		range have failed to record an individual. Surveys should be over a time 
		frame appropriate to the taxon’s life cycle and life form.<br>
		<br>
		<b>Critically Endangered (CR)</b><br>
		A taxon is Critically Endangered when the best available evidence 
		indicates that it meets any of the criteria A to E for Critically 
		Endangered (see Section V), and it is therefore considered to be facing 
		an extremely high risk of extinction in the wild.<br>
		<br>
		<b>Endangered (EN)</b><br>
		A taxon is Endangered when the best available evidence indicates that it 
		meets any of the criteria A to E for Endangered (see Section V), and it 
		is therefore considered to be facing a very high risk of extinction in 
		the wild.<br>
		<br>
		<b>Vulnerable (VU)</b><br>
		A taxon is Vulnerable when the best available evidence indicates that it 
		meets any of the criteria A to E for Vulnerable (see Section V), and it 
		is therefore considered to be facing a high risk of extinction in the 
		wild.<br>
		<br>
		<b>Near Threatened (NT)</b><br>
		A taxon is Near Threatened when it has been evaluated against the 
		criteria but does not qualify for Critically Endangered, Endangered or 
		Vulnerable now, but is close to qualifying for or is likely to qualify 
		for a threatened category in the near future.<br>
		<br>
		<b>Least Concern (LC)</b><br>
		A taxon is Least Concern when it has been evaluated against the criteria 
		and does not qualify for Critically Endangered, Endangered, Vulnerable 
		or Near Threatened. Widespread and abundant taxa are included in this 
		category.<br>
		<br>
		<b>Data Deficient (DD)</b><br>
		A taxon is Data Deficient when there is inadequate information to make a 
		direct, or indirect, assessment of its risk of extinction based on its 
		distribution and/or population status. A taxon in this category may be 
		well studied, and its biology well known, but appropriate data on 
		abundance and/or distribution are lacking. Data Deficient is therefore 
		not a category of threat. Listing of taxa in this category indicates 
		that more information is required and acknowledges the possibility that 
		future research will show that threatened classification is appropriate. 
		It is important to make positive use of whatever data are available. In 
		many cases great care should be exercised in choosing between DD and a 
		threatened status. If the range of a taxon is suspected to be relatively 
		circumscribed, and a considerable period of time has elapsed since the 
		last record of the taxon, threatened status may well be justified.<br>
		<br>
		<b>Not Evaluated (NE)</b><br>
		A taxon is Not Evaluated when it has not yet been evaluated against the 
		criteria.</font></td>
