		<br>
		The scientific and common names which are used in the Conservation Needs 
		Assessment software are derived from a combination of the
		<a target="_blank" href="http://www.iucnredlist.org/" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: 700">
		<font color="#006600">IUCN Red List</font></a> and the
		<a target="_blank" href="http://amphibiaweb.org" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: 700">
		<font color="#006600">AmphibiaWeb</font></a> database. These are the two 
		main taxonomic references that form the basis of the names in our 
		database.<br>
		<br>
		However, taxonomy is a very dynamic field of study and it is likely that 
		some of the scientific and common names in the current database might
		<a href="TaxonomicChanges.htm" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: 700">
		<font color="#006600">change</font></a> in the future. Unfortunately, 
		Amphibian Ark doesn’t have the necessary resources to stay on top of new 
		species names, changes to genera etc. and often we find that local 
		amphibian experts know one or several new species that aren't yet 
		included in the Red List or AmphibiaWeb. We recognize that it is 
		important to include all species in our database, along with the most 
		current species names, so we will add or update anything that is brought 
		to our attention.<br>
		<br>
		So, if you would find any errors or omissions in our species list, we 
		kindly ask you to send us an email at
		<a href="mailto:ConservationNeeds@amphibianark.org?subject=Conservation Needs Assessments" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: 700">
		<font color="#006600">ConservationNeeds@amphibianark.org</font></a> 
		indicating in the subject line that you would like a change made to the 
		species database, and send us the proposed change or addition. Please 
		also include a link to a valid reference document, so we can verify the 
		update. Please see the
		<a href="TaxonomicChanges.htm" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: 700">
