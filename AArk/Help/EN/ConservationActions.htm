		<font size="2">The work of conservation involves taking action with the 
		aim of protecting the remaining individuals of a species and 
		facilitating and promoting the reproduction of species (also in 
		captivity). Ultimately this should lead to conservation of a species for 
		the long run. <br>
		<br>
		Analysis of the data from each completed Conservation Needs Assessments 
		by the software results in the generation of one or more recommended 
		conservation actions for a species. The recommended actions for each 
		species are displayed in the banner information at the top of each

		(captive) conservation programs and two relate to <i>in situ </i>(in the 
		wild) conservation activities; there is also the possibility that no 
		conservation action is recommended at this time. <br>
		<br>
		The conservation actions that are generated by the data depend on 
		various criteria, including the <b>
		<a style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank" href="http://www.iucnredlist.org/">
		<font color="#006600">Red List</font></a></b> category and the <b>
		<a style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank" href="http://www.edgeofexistence.org/about/default.php">
		<font color="#006600">EDGE score</font></a></b>. Each conservation 
		action has its distinct set of criteria and these are described below.<br>
		</font><br>
		<font color="#006600"><a name="Ark"></a>Ark</font><br>
		<font size="2">A species that is extinct in the wild (locally or 
		globally) and which would become completely extinct without ex situ 
		management.</font></font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial"><font size="2">The criterion for Ark species is:<br>
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;
		• IUCN Red List category = Extinct in the Wild (EW)<br>
		<br>
		Ark species can no longer be found in the wild, but still have 
		individuals living in one or more populations in zoos, aquariums or 
		other captive facilities. These captive populations are managed very 
		carefully to ensure the genetic variation within them and to ensure that 
		these populations continue to breed. Large-scale efforts in the wild are 
		needed for alleviating the threats that caused the species to become 
		extinct in the wild, so that eventually, captive-bred animals can be 
		released back into a safe environment.<br>
		<br>
		Examples of Ark species are the Wyoming Toad (<i>Anaxyrus baxteri</i>) from the 
		United States of America and the Kihansi Spray Toad (<i>Nectophrynoides 
		asperginis</i>) from Tanzania, although release efforts are now underway 
		with the Kihansi Spray Toad.</font><br>
		<br>
		<font color="#006600"><a name="Rescue"></a>Rescue</font><br>
		<font size="2">A species that is in imminent danger of extinction 
		(locally or globally) and requires <i>ex situ </i>management, as part of an 
		integrated program, to ensure its survival.<br>
		<br>
		The criteria for Rescue species are:<br>
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;
		• IUCN Red List category is not Extinct in the Wild (EW) <br>
		<br>
		<b>And</b><br>
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;
		• Threat Mitigation = Threats cannot/will not be reversed in time to 
		prevent likely species extinction.<br>
		<br>
		Rescue species, unlike the Ark species, still survive in the wild, but 
		the threats being faced by them likely will result in species 
		extinction if no action is taken. This means that the future of these 
		species needs to be saved by managing populations in captivity, with the 
		necessary focus on genetic variation and continued breeding. At the same 
		time <i>in situ </i>research is needed to investigate the threats in the 
		species’ natural habitat. Only when these threats are under control can 
		these species be reintroduced in their natural habitat.<br>
		<br>
		Examples of Rescue species are the Mallorcan Midwife Toad (<i>Alytes 
		muletensis</i>), found only on the island of Mallorca in the Mediterranean 
		Sea, and the Chiriqui Harlequin Frog (<i>Atelopus chiriquiensis</i>) from 
		Ecuador, whose decline is linked to chytridiomycosis. <br>

		<font color="#006600"><i><a name="InSituConservation"></a>In Situ</i> Conservation</font><br>
		<font size="2">A species for which mitigation of threats in the wild may 
		still bring about its successful conservation.<br>
		<br>
		The criteria for <i>In Situ </i>Conservation species are:<br>
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;
		• Threat Mitigation = Threats are reversible in time frame that will 
		prevent further decline/extinction <br>
		<br>

		<p><font face="Arial"><font size="2"><i>In situ </i>conservation refers to protecting a species in its natural 
		habitat. For some of these species the threats they face are still 
		reversible and its population(s) can be saved by managing their habitat 
		adequately. For other species the threats are more severe, but as there 
		is currently no protected habitat available for them, creating protected 
		habitat might be the key to their survival. By purchasing land and 
		protecting it for conservation purposes or by lobbying governments for 
		additional national parks, the threats to these species can be mitigated 
		by providing them with safer and/or better habitats. <br>
		<br>
		Examples of <i>In Situ </i>Conservation species are the Ornamented Pygmy Frog (<i>Microhyla 
		ornata</i>), a species from the Indian Subcontinent and the Collared Poison 
		Frog (<i>Mannophryne collaris</i>) a species endemic to Venezuela.<br>
		</font><br>
		<font color="#006600"><i><a name="InSituResearch"></a>In Situ </i>Research</font><br>
		<font size="2">A species that for one or more reasons requires further 
		in situ research to be carried out as part of the conservation action 
		for the species. One or more critical pieces of information is not known 
		at this time.<br>
		<br>
		The criteria for <i>In Situ </i>Research species are:<br>
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;
		• IUCN Red List category = Data Deficient (DD) <b>Or</b><br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;
		• Threat Mitigation = Unknown <b>Or</b><br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;
		• Protected Habitat = Unknown <b>Or</b><br>

		&nbsp;&nbsp;
		• Taxonomic Status = No <b>Or</b><br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;
		• Founder Specimens = Unknown <b>Or</b><br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;
		• Conservation role = Rescue.<br>
		<br>
		For an <i>In Situ </i>Research species further research about the status in the 
		wild is required, for instance about the threats it is facing, the exact 
		size of the population or the trends in population numbers. Without 
		these data it is hard to decide on which strategy would be best to save 
		the species and where action should be focused. A good example of <i>in 
		situ </i>research are the studies on amphibian chytrid fungus: whether the 
		disease is present in a certain area and how it might spread throughout 
		populations. <br>
		<br>
		Examples of <i>In Situ </i>Research species are Ainsworth's Salamander (<i>Plethodon 
		ainsworthi</i>), considered to be extinct, but research is needed in case it 
		reappears, and Rose's Ghost Frog (<i>Heleophryne rosei</i>) that has a cultural 
		significance to South Africans. <br>

		<i>Ex situ </i>research for amphibians can vary over a wide range of 
		disciplines including nutrition and husbandry, display and education, 
		population genetics, health and reproduction technologies. The knowledge 
		that is obtained in a captive setting, for instance in zoos or 
		aquariums, can then be used to help the preservation of this species or 
		a related species in the wild. For example, research in Hanoi on captive 
		Vietnamese Mossy Frogs (<i>Theloderma corticale</i>) has provided information 
		on larval development and larval stages in this species. This 
		information is crucial for the proper determination of anuran larval 
		stages in the wild both for inventories of frog diversity and habitat 
		assessments, which are important data sets for other potential 
		conservation actions.<br>
		<br>
		Other examples of <i>Ex Situ </i>Research species are <i>Eleutherodactylus corona</i>, 
		endemic to Haiti and <i>Dermophis glandulosus </i>a caecilian from Colombia, 
		Costa Rica, and Panama.<br>

		<font color="#006600"><a name="MassProduction"></a>Mass Production in Captivity</font><br>
		<font size="2">A species threatened through wild collection (e.g. as a 
		food resource), which could be or is currently being bred in captivity – 
		normally in-country, ex situ - to replace a demand for specimens 
		collected from the wild. Generally the captive-breeding of pet and 
		hobbyist species is excluded from this category, except in exceptional 
		circumstances where coordinated, managed breeding programs can 
		demonstrably reduce wild collection of a threatened species.</font><p>
		<font size="2">The criteria for Mass Production in Captivity species are:</font></p>

		<br>
		<b>And</b> <br>
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;
		• Species is suffering from over-collection from the wild.<br>
		<br>
		Species like the Chinese Giant Salamander (<i>Andrias davidianus</i>) are 
		currently under threat, because many individuals are collected in the 
		wild to be used as a food source or for the pet trade. To alleviate the 
		pressure of overharvesting from the wild, some species are (or can be) 
		mass produced in captivity and then sold into the food trade or into the 
		pet trade.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2">Examples are the Fanged River Frog (<i>Limnonectes macrodon</i>) from Indonesia 
		and the Titicaca Water Frog (<i>Telmatobius culeus</i>) that lives high up in 
		the Andes, and which some people use to make a popular frog juice that

		<br>
		Species belonging to this category are selected with the aim of helping

		• There is suitable habitat available for reintroduction.<br>

		Supplementation refers to animals that are captive bred and released

		In general the numbers of these populations in the wild are so small 
		that natural reproduction alone cannot ensure the survival of the 
		species. By breeding them in captivity and releasing those individuals 
		into the wild, the numbers of the wild populations increase and the 
		population should once again be self-sustaining. Supplementation can

		<font size="2">A species for which the long-term storage of sperm or

		<font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><font face="Arial">
		<font size="2">• Recommended conservation role is Ark or Rescue<br>
		<br>
		Species for which biobanking is recommended, are under imminent danger

		research can continue into their evolutionary histories. More 
		importantly, the hope is that one day we will be able to use cells from 
		the frozen tissue samples to produce animals using advanced cloning 
		techniques.<br>
