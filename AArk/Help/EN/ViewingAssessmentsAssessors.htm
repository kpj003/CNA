		an assessment is marked as complete and saved, the software will then 
		generate the recommended conservation actions. A total score is 
		calculated for each species assessment, based on the values of the 
		answers provided by the Assessor. This score is then used to prioritize 
		species within reports of recommended national and global conservation 
		actions. The scores for each species are not displayed on the assessment 
		results, as they are relevant only when compared with other species for 
		prioritization purposes.</font></p>
