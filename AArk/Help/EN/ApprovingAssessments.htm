		Conservation Needs Assessments are added and updated by
		<a href="Assessors.htm" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: 700">
		<font color="#006600">Assessors</font></a> - people with appropriate 
		levels of expertise in the current status of amphibians in the wild 
		and/or in captivity. Anyone who would like to be an Assessor can apply 
		using the Assessor Signup form from the Home page of the application.<br>
		<br>
		To ensure a consistent level of detail and accuracy across assessments 
		that have been added by multiple Assessors,
		<a href="NationalFacilitators.htm" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: 700">
		<font color="#006600">National Facilitators</font></a> review and 
		approve all assessments for species within their country or region of 
		expertise. National Facilitators are usually national IUCN
		<a target="_blank" href="http://www.amphibians.org/asg/members/" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: 700">
		<font color="#006600">Amphibian Specialist Group (ASG) Chairs</font></a>, 
		or other national experts delegated by the Chairs. Although assessments 
		that have not yet been approved are visible to other Assessors, they are 
		not included on the View Assessments page, or within National Assessment 
		reports until they have been approved.<br>
		<br>
		When a new or an updated assessment is marked as complete by the 
		Assessor, the relevant National Facilitator is notified, and they can 
		then review the assessment. If they are happy with the content, and with 
		the level of supporting notes, they will then approve the assessment. If 
		they have any concerns with the assessment, the National Facilitator 
		will then contact the Assessor and discuss their concerns. When the 
		concerns have been addressed, the National Facilitator will then mark 
		the assessment as approved.</font></font></td>
