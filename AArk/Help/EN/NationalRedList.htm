		National Red List assessments?</font><br>
		<br>
		<font size="2">Regional or National Red List assessments focus on the 
		status of biodiversity within specific areas. They refine the
		<a href="IUCNRedList.htm" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: 700">
		<font color="#006600">global Red List assessments</font></a> into vital 
		conservation tools for regional and national policy, and conservation 
		planning. National Red Lists may reflect national action plans or 
		directives. The
		<a target="_blank" href="http://www.iucnredlist.org" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: 700">
		<font color="#006600">IUCN Red List</font></a> includes the global 
		status of species; only global-level assessments are included in the 
		list. Regional or national-level assessments are only included in the 
		IUCN Red List if they are for species that are endemic to those regions 
		or countries. <br>
		<br>
		Over 100 countries and regions have so far developed National and 
		Regional Red Lists. Regional and national lists are usually country-led 
		initiatives, and are not centralized in any way; they differ from each 
		other widely in terms of scope and quality but are very useful to guide 
		conservation work at sub-global levels. <br>
		<br>
		The IUCN Red List successfully highlights global biodiversity loss, 
		however it may not always identify declines at sub-global levels. 
		Regional Red Lists are therefore important to highlight the status of 
		taxa within specific geographic areas.<br>
		<br>
		Where they exist, national Red List assessments are used in preference 
		to global assessments in the Conservation Needs Assessments.</font></font><blockquote>

			and IV of the Habitats Directive or Appendices II or III of the Bern
