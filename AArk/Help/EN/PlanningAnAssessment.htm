		Amphibian Conservation Needs Assessment</font><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
		<br>
		One of the key components of the Conservation Needs Assessment process 
		is to organize for assessments for all amphibian species in a country, 
		as the first step in the development of a national amphibian 
		conservation action plan.<br>
		<br>
		Between 2007 and the end of 2014, Amphibian Ark staff facilitated 26
		<a target="_blank" href="http://www.amphibianark.org/planning-workshops/" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: 700">
		<font color="#006600">national or regional workshops</font></a> to 
		assess the conservation needs of 3,375 (46%) of the world’s amphibian 
		species. These workshops brought together key stakeholders in amphibian 
		conservation, primarily the leading amphibian field biologists and 
		researchers, but also representatives from the <i>ex situ </i>amphibian 
		conservation community and government wildlife agencies as well as 
		university students. National IUCN

		<font color="#006600">Amphibian Specialist Group (ASG) Chairs</font></a> 
		are usually responsible for arranging the workshop and determining the 
		most appropriate amphibian experts {<font color="#FF0000">link to Who 
		are the assessors?</font>} to carry out the assessments.<br>
		<br>
		Because funding for physical workshops has become scarce, it was decided 
		to build an online application to replicate the assessment process. In 
		late 2014 development began on a new, online assessment program, and all 
		past assessments have been migrated into the online database. <br>
		<br>
		From 2015 onwards, national conservation needs assessments can now be 
		undertaken either during a physical workshop or by using the online 
		program. Assessments from previous workshops can also be reviewed and 
		updated using the online process. <br>
		<br>
		Advantages and disadvantages of both the workshop and the online method 
		of assessment are discussed below, along with suggestions for planning 
		national assessments.<br>
		<br>
		<b>Workshop-based assessments</b><br>
		Workshop-based assessments bring together the leading amphibian experts 
		for the country’s amphibians, along with other relevant stakeholders, 
		for a multi-day workshop. The length of the workshop depends on the 
		number of species to be assessed, but on average, 40-60 species can be 
		assessed each day during a workshop. The workshop ends with the 
		discussion of recommendations and of the next steps {<font color="#FF0000">link 
		to What happens after a national assessment?</font>} needed for 
		implementing those conservation actions.<br>
		<br>
		<i><b>Advantages</b></i></font><ul>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>All expertise in one place</i>: 
			Leading experts are all in the same place at the same time, meaning 
			consensus on differing expertise/knowledge can usually be reached 
			easily.</font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>Efficient</i>: An assessment 
			which includes all species in the country can be undertaken in a 
			relatively short period of time.</font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>Stakeholders more involved</i>: 
			Relevant stakeholders are included in the assessments, and are 
			therefore familiar with the process. Therefore, they have a much 
			better understanding of how the recommended conservation actions 
			were developed. Stakeholders who will be responsible for 
			implementing recommended conservation actions have better “buy-in”, 
			since they were involved in the decision-making process.</font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>Room for discussion</i>: Good 
			opportunity to review the assessments and recommendations as a group 
			and to discuss the next steps required to implement the conservation 
			actions.</font></li>
		</ul>
		<p><i><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Disadvantages</b></font></i></p>
		<ul>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>Costs</i>: Funding is required to 
			cover the costs of participants’ travel, workshop facilities, food, 
			accommodation and an experienced assessment facilitator. Although 
			costs can vary considerably, the average assessment workshop costs 
			between US$12,000 - US$20,000.</font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>Funding takes time</i>: It can 
			take between six months to two years to secure the funding required 
			to hold a workshop.</font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>Limit to number of experts 
			present</i>: generally participation is limited to around 15-20 
			participants (including stakeholders other than the assessors), 
			meaning that some experts might not be included during the workshop.</font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>Hard to pick a date</i>: 
			Scheduling a suitable time to bring all experts and key stakeholders 
			together can be difficult, especially if some of those experts spend 
			considerable time in the field.</font></li>
		</ul>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Online assessments</b><br>
		Using the online process, assessors generally work in isolation from 
		each other, and without an experienced facilitator. The combined 
		assessments from multiple individual assessors are consolidated into a 
		single set of assessments for each country.<br>
		<br>
		<i><b>Advantages</b></i></font></p>
		<ul>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>Can be undertaken at any time</i>:- 
			assessors are not restricted to a few specific days at a workshop.</font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>Fits in schedule</i>: Assessors 
			can complete assessments in their own time, without being taken away 
			from their daily work routine.</font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>More inclusive</i>: - a larger 
			number of assessors can contribute to a national assessment.</font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>Low costs</i>: Minimal cost when 
			compared to workshop-based assessments.</font></li>
		</ul>
		<p><i><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Disadvantages</font></b></i></p>
		<ul>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>Less focus</i>: Assessors might 
			not be totally focussed on the task, and therefore, assessing all 
			species can take considerable time.</font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>No experienced facilitator</i>: 
			Absence of an experienced facilitator to address questions or fully 
			explain aspects of the assessment process.</font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>Dependent on availability 
			internet</i>: Access to the internet required to add, update or 
			review assessments.</font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>Harder to reach consensus</i>: 
			Contradictory responses might skew the overall assessment and 
			recommendation when multiple, differing assessments are 
			consolidated.</font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>Bias to certain species</i>: Some 
			species in a country might not be assessed - assessors may tend to 
			favour the most threatened species, leaving the most common species 
			unassessed. This results not only in an incomplete national 
			assessment, but species that might be recommended for actions such 
			as <i>ex situ </i>research into husbandry of more threatened species 
			(i.e. analog species), might not be included in the recommended 
			conservation actions.</font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>Stakeholders less involved</i>: 
			Key stakeholders, other than the assessors (e.g. government wildlife 
			agencies, <i>ex situ</i> conservation community etc.) are not 
			included in the assessment process and might have less “buy-in” when 
			it comes to implementing the recommended conservation actions.</font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>Less group discussion</i>: Less 
			opportunity to review the completed assessments and recommendations 
			as a group and to determine the next steps required to implement the 
			conservation actions.</font></li>
		</ul>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Planning for a workshop-based 
		assessment</b><br>
		Planning for a workshop-based assessment usually includes the following 
		broad actions. It requires the host to dedicate considerable planning 
		time, and good communication between the host (usually the ASG Chair(s)), 
		the Amphibian Ark facilitator, and the participants is required.</font></p>
		<ul>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="2">Prepare a draft workshop budget, 
			based on the number of participants, and the number of species to be 
			assessed, and including transport costs, accommodation, food, 
			workshop venue and an experienced facilitator.</font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="2">Work with AArk staff to apply for 
			funding from a range of potential funding bodies.</font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="2">Work with AArk staff to prepare 
			assessment workbooks, including a complete national species list, 
			along with any national Red List assessment data that might exist. 
			Send pre-working reading material to all participants.</font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="2">Hold the workshop.</font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="2">Aim to assess all species during the 
			workshop, with several hours afterwards for review and planning on 
			next steps.</font></li>
		</ul>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Planning for an online assessment</b><br>
		An online assessment requires considerable planning and monitoring by 
		the host (usually the ASG Chair(s)). It involves the following 
		activities:</font></p>
		<ul>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="2">Determine the list of assessors 
			required to collectively include expertise in all species in the 
			country.</font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="2">Work with AArk staff to ensure that 
			the online database includes a complete national species list, and 
			that any national Red List data have been added to the database.</font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="2">Ensure that all assessors have 
			registered in the online program as assessors.</font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="2">Actively encourage assessors to 
			complete their assessments according to a pre-determined timeframe.</font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="2">Encourage assessors to review 
			species in that country which have been added by other assessors, 
			and to contact those assessors if they have concerns with their 
			data.</font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="2">Consider a physical or web-based 
			meeting (such as Skype) once or twice during the assessment 
			timeframe to help with any questions, keep the momentum going, and 
			to ensure that no one is falling behind. AArk staff are happy to 
			join these Skype calls if we can be of help - we have English and 
			Spanish-speaking facilitators who can help.</font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="2">ASG Chair(s) or other national 
			facilitator reviews and approves all assessments.</font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="2">Review species that have not yet 
			been assessed, and encourage assessors to add data for those 
			species.</font></li>
